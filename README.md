# amsterdam-trees
Amsterdam Trees is an experimental music app which synthesize music in real time based on the trees of beautiful Amsterdam. Walk or bike around and experience an connection with the trees around you.

This app was a lot of hard work to make. It takes to much time and effort to keep it updated to contineous changing policy requirements rules. So unfortenately the app is no longer available in the google play store...

But there is kind of GOOD NEWS :)
-------------------------------------
For those who still want to try out the app, there is a crappy workaround:

1. Download the amsterdam_trees.apk to your android device
2. If neccesary, make sure it's allowed to install from the location where you have put the apk file
3. While installing the apk it will tell you it's unsafe... (you have to trust me here...)
4. Click on 'more details' and 'install anyway'
5. If neccesary, enter your pincode of your phone
6. The install should continue and you are ready to enjoy the app!
7. Thanks!
