This app was a lot of hard work to make. It takes to much time and effort to keep it updated to contineous changing policy requirements rules. So unfortenately the app is no longer available in the google play store...

But there is also (kind of) GOOD NEWS!
-------------------------------------
For those who still want to try out the app...there is a crappy workaround:

1. Download the file amsterdam_trees.apk to your android device
2. If neccesary, make sure it's allowed to install from the location where you have put the apk file
3. While installing the apk it will tell you it's unsafe... (you have to trust me here...)
4. Click on 'more details' and 'install anyway'
5. If neccesary, enter your pincode of your phone
6. The install should continue and you are ready to use the app!
7. Enjoy :)

And for those who are interested in the source code, check the src folder.
