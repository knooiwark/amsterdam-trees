There is a quick and dirty way of installing the app on your device:

1. Download the file amsterdam_trees.apk to your android device
2. If neccesary, make sure it's allowed to install from the location where you have put the apk file
3. While installing the apk it will tell you it's unsafe... (you have to trust me here...)
4. Click on 'more details' and 'install anyway'
5. If neccesary, enter your pincode of your phone
6. The install should continue and you are ready to use the app!
7. Enjoy :)
